# ICPC code

This contains some assorted code intended to be used on ICPC problems.

## Geometry

An implementation of geometric operators based on geometric algebra, which provides a very powerful mathematical basis for a variety of geometric operations. geometry-simple provides a simpler but less efficient implementation. geometry.hpp is an optimized but more complicated implementation and is currently incomplete.
